### Computer Programming Languages
- **Low-Level:** Close to machine language (0s and 1s). Examples: Assembly, Machine Code.
- **High-Level:** Easier to code, must be translated for machines. Examples: Java, Python.
- **Compilers:** Convert high-level language to machine code.
- **Compiler Phases:** Scanning, Lexical Analysis, Syntax Analysis, Semantic Analysis
- **Object Code:** The compiled version of your source code (still in binary form).
### Assemblers, Linkers, and Loaders
- **Assembler:** Translates assembly code to machine code.
- **Linker:** Combines object files from multiple sources into a single executable program.
- **Loader:** Loads the executable program into memory for the computer to run.
### Translators

| Type        | Converts                            | Example      | Notes                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| Compiler    | High-Level Language to Machine Code | C++, Java    | Whole Program at Once |
| Interpreter | High-Level Language to Machine Code | Python, PHP  | Line-by-Line, Slower  |
| Assembler   | Assembly to Machine Code            | x86 Assembly | Close to Hardware     |
### Processor Key Components
- **Control Unit (CU):** Manages instructions and data flow.
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Does calculations and logic.
- **Registers:** Super-fast internal storage.
### Processor Operations
1. **Fetch Instruction**
2. **Interpret Instruction**
3. **Fetch Data** (if needed)
4. **Process Data** (ALU does the work)
5. **Write Data** (save results somewhere)
### Number Systems
- **Binary (Base-2):** Uses 0 and 1. Computers understand this directly.
- **Hexadecimal (Base-16):** Uses 0-9 and A-F. More compact for humans to read.
- **Conversions:** Practice converting between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal
- **Complements:** Used in computers for math and logic. 1's complement is inverting bits, 2's is inverting + adding 1.
